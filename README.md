# ruby-tic-tac-toe

This is my take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, using object oriented programming.

## Tic Tac Toe Assignment

Build a tic-tac-toe game that runs in the console and is played between two players. Each turn should be displayed on a board using the console. Use object oriented programming principles to build the project. Plan the project carefully, keep information between classes encapsulated.

## My Plan To Build Tic Tac Toe

- Game Menu to handle beginning the game and displaying the board each turn.
- Player Class to handle the player's choices
- Game Board Class to handle displaying the board and placing the x's and o's on the appropriate coordinates.
- Game Score Class to handle the win conditions for the game.
